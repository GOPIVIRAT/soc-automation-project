# SOC Automation Project using Wazuh

This project showcases a complete SOC (Security Operations Center) automation workflow using **Wazuh**, designed to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real-time.

## 🚀 Project Features

- ## ✅ Features Implemented

- ✅ Integration with Sysmon for detailed Windows event monitoring  
- ✅ File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
- ✅ VirusTotal integration for threat detection  
- ✅ YARA rules for malware detection  
- ✅ Email security checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- ✅ Email alert automation  
- ✅ Automatic deletion of suspicious downloaded files with real-time alerts  
- ✅ Detection and alerting of suspicious PowerShell command execution patterns  
- ✅ Malware behavior detection and classification alerts  
- ✅ Brute-force attack detection and alerting (e.g., failed login attempts, authentication abuse)

  


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Wazuh SIEM  
- Sysmon  
- YARA  
- VirusTotal API    
- Python

## 🎯 Project Goal

To automate detection and response in a SOC environment using open-source tools, minimizing manual analyst effort and reducing response time.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Real-world use of SIEM tools  
- Writing custom detection rules  
- Analyzing event logs and alerts  
- Automating threat responses  
- Visualizing security data  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🌐 **Network-Level Security Integration**  
  Plan to extend beyond host-based detection by incorporating IDS/IPS tools like **Suricata** or **Snort** for monitoring and defending network traffic.

- 🤖 **AI/ML-Based Threat Detection**  
  Leverage machine learning to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and automate decision-making in threat classification and response.

- 🔁 **Full Incident Response Automation**  
  Implement SOAR capabilities to auto-isolate infected hosts, block malicious IPs, and notify analysts with enriched threat context.

- 📊 **Advanced Visualization Dashboards**  
  Design intuitive dashboards in **Kibana** or **Grafana** for real-time SOC monitoring across endpoints and networks.

- ☁️ **Cloud Monitoring Integration**  
  Future plans include integrating monitoring for cloud platforms like AWS and Azure for hybrid threat visibility.
